> iTween Visual Editor v 1.0.2

> iTween has removed their implementation of CameraFade-related features, and so those has been commented out. For users of older iTween versions, feel free to uncomment those. 
	> Special thankies to Heriberto Diaz for pointing that one out!

> Thank you for your support! I had made this tool for fun, but seeing people using it make me extra happy!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

> iTween Visual Editor v 1.0.2

> iTween is owned by PixelPlacement. iTween is necessary in order for this package to work.

> In order to use it, add a component to your GameObject called "iTweenAnimation".

> From there, you can add various iTweens, with various parameters.

> You can either use the default view of an iTween, either use full control. While in full control, add
> as many parameters as you feel you need. Remember that in order for the iTween to work, some are essential.

> Your tweens can be activated via code using the this.GetComponent<iTweenAnimation> ().iTweenStart ();

> More documentation on iTween on http://itween.pixelplacement.com/documentation.php

> My package is only a visual interface used in order to fascilitate the use of iTween, especially for non-coders.

> If there's any iTween I didn't include, that you want to see in this asset, please email me at hizidev@gmail.com



> Thankies to Verty for being awesome and support me as always. Forever and ever~
